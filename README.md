**CanvaAI** is an open-source Python project providing tools to interact with Canva's AI features by making requests to its underlying API. It essentially acts as a scraper, offering both an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) and a Python library for programmatic access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository is still in its early stages and will continue to be developed with more features. If you would like to contribute, please see the contribution guidelines [here](#-contributing).**
>
> There are still unknown bugs :)

This project is intended for educational and research purposes.

### Under development
- [ ] As a python library
- [ ] Canva ai image generator
- [ ] Canva general chat
- [ ] Cookies files with the format

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get CanvaAI up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Valid Canva cookies (you'll need to extract these from your browser after logging into Canva)

### Installation

<!-- You can install CanvaAI directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install canvaai
``` -->

<!-- Alternatively, for the latest development version, you can clone this repository and install it locally: -->

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyntxFlow/canvaAI.git
cd canvaAI
poetry install
poetry build
```

## üíª Usage

CanvaAI can be used either via its interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) or as a Python library in your own scripts.

### Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI)

CanvaAI offers an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) for a more user-friendly experience directly in your terminal. This mode provides a visual, menu-driven, or prompt-based way to interact with Canva AI features without leaving your console.

You will need a `cookies.txt` file containing your Canva authentication cookies.

```bash
python -m canvaai --cookies cookies.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--cookies cookies.txt` argument is shown as an example for passing the cookies file. Your TUI might have other ways to load cookies or other initial configuration flags.</br></br>
> Your `cookies.txt` file should be in a format that your script can parse (e.g., Netscape cookie file format or a simple key=value per line).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The cookies.txt file must be in netscape format!**
> 
> Get it via chrome extension [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)

<!-- ### As a Python Library

You can integrate CanvaAI's functionalities into your Python applications.

First, install the library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install canvaai
```

Then, you can use it in your Python code:

```python
from canvaai.client import Client

# Path to your cookies file or the cookie string itself
# Netscape format
COOKIES_FILE_PATH = "cookies.txt"

try:
    # Initialize the client
    client = Client(cookies=COOKIES_FILE_PATH)

    # Example: Generate an image
    prompt = "Create a modern website with dark mode and responsive features"
    code_data = client.code_generator(
        prompt=prompt,
    )

    if code_data:
        with open("generated_canva_image.png", "wb") as f:
            f.write(code_data)
        print(f"Image successfully generated and saved to generated_canva_image.png")
    else:
        print("Failed to generate image.")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Cookies file not found at {COOKIES_FILE_PATH}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
``` -->
